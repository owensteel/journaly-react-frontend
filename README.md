The Typescript + React frontend for my sample resume application, "Journaly".

It is a simple React application where users can journal their progress on certain goals, with accountability. Goals are created by the user, and each goal has a journal that users can write entries for. The journal also provides a chart giving data on when the user has historically been most likely to make an entry for a goal, and gives a recommendation for setting aside that time in future for that specific goal. To follow the theme of accountability, a key feature is a push notifications system that reminds the user regularly to journal any updates they have on their progress for a goal.

# Remote

This frontend application (at the time of writing) is hosted on a subdomain of my personal portfolio website, at https://journaly.ow.st.

# Local

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
