The Typescript + React frontend for my sample resume project, "Journaly". This web frontend application is live on a subdomain of my personal portfolio website, at https://journaly.ow.st.

It is a simple React application where users can journal their progress on certain goals with accountability.

Goals are created by the user, and each goal has a journal that users can write entries for.

The journal also provides a chart giving data on when the user has historically been most likely to make an entry for a goal, and gives a recommendation for setting aside that time in future for that specific goal.

To follow the theme of accountability, a key feature is a push notifications system that reminds the user regularly to journal any updates they have on their progress for a goal.

# Hosting locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
